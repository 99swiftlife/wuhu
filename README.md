## Asynchronous simplification:</br>
We provide 8 examples. </br>
Input the examples in the input folder into the main function, and the program will output the transformed examples.</br>
For the transformed examples, we also provide a form that combines send and receive.</br>
You can also find the converted examples directly in the output folder. </br>

## Use duet to verify the c program:
In the computer equipped with duet software (Linux operating system), start the system terminal under the duet folder and enter the command:</br>
<I>./duet.native -proofspace &lt;c file relative path &gt;</I></br>
You can get the verification result</br>
