##Asynchronous simplification:
We provide 8 examples. 
Input the examples in the input folder into the main function, and the program will output the transformed examples.
For the transformed examples, we also provide a form that combines send and receive.
You can also find the converted examples directly in the output folder. 

##Use duet to verify the c program:
In the computer equipped with duet software (Linux operating system), start the system terminal under the duet folder and enter the command:
./duet.native -proofspace <c file relative path>
You can get the verification result
